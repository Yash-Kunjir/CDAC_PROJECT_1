# CDAC_PROJECT_1
#Develop A Predictive Model To Accurately Forecast Hourly Traffic Volumes At Different Road Junctions Based On Historical Traffic Data
#Explore the factors influencing traffic congestion at different junctions, and build a model that will help solve the widespread problem of congestion through targeted interventions. The following are deliverables #in project 
#1)Trained Models (Jupyter Notebook) 
#2)Report on Peak Hour Traffic Analysis 
#3)Report on Comparative Analysis of Junctions 
#4)Report on Model Evaluation & Refinement
